Acyually very often by convention in events we use delegate type EventHandler.

public delegate void EventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);

This one takes 2 arguments. First one is an object that emmited this event.
And second - additional parameters we pass through event.

public class EventArgs
{
    public static readonly EventArgs Empty;//represents an event with no event data.

    public EventArgs();
}

Also there is a generic EventHandler:

public delegate void EventHandler<TEventArgs>(object sender, TEventArgs e);
