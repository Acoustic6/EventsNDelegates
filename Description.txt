We can avoid writing custom delegate MeDelegate using existing delegate named Func 
that is a certain type of generic delegate which returns T and takes in up to 16 parameters.
The returning parameter is always the last one.

public delegate TResult Func<in T, out TResult>(T arg)

there is also predefined delegate Action that returns void and takes no arguments

public delegate void Action()
